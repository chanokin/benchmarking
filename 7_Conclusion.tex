\subsection{What we have said and done}
%The Proposal: Advantages
In this work we propose an set of image conversion methods, in particular we have performed a full conversion of the MNIST database. Our implementations are open-source and can be obtained from a public repository.

In order to ease the understanding and comparison of investigation results, we suggest that researchers report typical neural networks characteristics as well as others that we believe are important (e.g. events per time unit, time per sample, response time).

The use of neuromorphic hardware in research is increasing, some of its characteristics may alter simulation results. We encourage researchers to describe some hardware characteristics that have a direct implication in the performance of neural networks.

\subsection{The future direction of developing the database}
What are the future algorithms we are encouraging.
