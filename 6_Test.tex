\section{Case Studies}
\label{sec:test}
In this section, we present two recognition SNN models working on the Poissonian subset of the NE15-MNIST dataset.
Their network components, training and testing methods are described according to the evaluation methodology stated above.
The specific spike-based evaluations on input event rates and responding latency are also provided. 
Meanwhile, as tentative benchmarks the models are implemented on SpiNNaker to assess the performance against software simulators.
Presenting proper benchmarks for vision recognition systems is still under investigation, the case studies only make an attempt.

\subsection{Case Study I}
It is a simple two-layered network where the input neurons receive Poissonian presented spike trains from the dataset and fully connect to the decision neurons.
The model utilises Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, and the parameters are all with biological means, see the listed values in Table~\ref{tbl:pynnSetting}.
The connections between the input neurons and the decision neurons are plastic, so the connection weights can be modulated during training with standard STDP learning rule.
The model is described with PyNN and the code is published in\footnote {https://github.com/qian-liu/benchmarking/tree/master/code/case\_study\_I} the same github repository with the dataset.
Considering to be a potential benchmark, this system is composed with simple neural models, trained with standard learning rules and written in unified SNN description language thus to apply the same network on various simulators both software and hardware.
%Consequently, the benchmark can be directly run on different SNN simulators as long as PyNN is supported.
%Besides, any modification on neuron or learning model is not required since only standard models are used.
%During training, each decision neuron is triggered by a teaching neuron while the weights of the synaptic connections of the input neurons and the decision neuron are modulated with standard STDP learning rule, see Fig~\ref{Fig:train}.

Both the training and testing exploit the Poissonian subset of the NE15-MNIST dataset.
Because different simulators generate random Poissonian spike trains with various mechanisms, languages and codes, using the same dataset is able to evaluate performance of these simulators without the interference by the non-unified input.
In terms of this case study, the performance of the model was evaluated with both software simulation (on NEST~[\cite{gewaltig2007nest}]) and hardware implementation (on SpiNNaker).

In order to fully assess the performance, different settings have been configured on the network, such as network size, input rate and testing images duration.
For simplicity of describing the system, one standard configuration is set as example in the following sections.

%\subsection{Description of the data used}
\subsubsection{Training}

There are two layers in the model: 28$\times$28 input neurons fully connect to 100 decision neurons.
Each decision neuron responds to a certain template of a digit.
In the standard configuration, there are 10 decision neurons answering a same digit with slightly different templates.
Those templates are embedded in the connection weights between the two layers.
Fig~\ref{Fig:train} shows how the connections to a single decision neuron is tuned.

The training set of $60,000$ hand written digits are firstly classified into 100 classes, 10 subclasses per digit, using K-means clusters.
So the images in a certain subclass are used to train one corresponding decision neuron.
The firing rate of the input neurons are assigned linearly according to their intensities and normalised with a total firing rate of 2000~$Hz$.
All the images together are presented 180~$s$ (about 300~$ms$ per image) during training and at the same time a teaching signal of 50~$Hz$ is conveyed to the decision neuron to trigger STDP learning.
The trained weights are plotted in accordance with the positions of the decision neurons in Fig~\ref{Fig:test}.

\end{figure} 



\subsubsection{Testing}
After training the weights of the plastic synapses are set to static, keeping the state of the weights on the last moment during training.
%The weights were normalised after training and applied to the same network.
And the weak weights were set to inhibitory connections with an identical strength.
%The output neurons inhibited all the other neurons as a winner take all circuit.
The feed-forward testing network is shown in Fig~\ref{Fig:test} where Poissonion spike trains are generated the same way as in the training.
The input neurons convey the same spike trains to every decision neuron through its responding trained synaptic weights. 
Every testing image ($10,000$ images in total) is presented once and lasts 1 second with a silence of 100~ms between them.
the output neuron with the highest firing rate decides.
Taken the trained weights from NEST simulation, the accuracy of the recognition on NEST as well reaches 90.01\% with the standard configuration.
In comparison, trained and tested on SpiNNaker the recognition rate is \textcolor{red}{**.**\%}.
While taken the same NEST trained weights, the result turns to be a slight drop to 89.88\%.
%In order to compare the recognition difference, another experiment on SpiNNaker is taken to test with the same NEST trained weights.
The recording of the output neurons of a test sequence of digits (4, 1, 1, 0, 9, 3, 1, 9, 4, 6) is shown in the raster plot (Fig~\ref{Fig:output}).

	\label{Fig:output}
\end{figure} 
\subsubsection{Evaluation}
The evaluation starts from the hardware-independent part, especially on the spike-based recognition analysis.
As mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:model}, accuracy and response time (latency) are the main concerns assessing the recognition capability.
Regarding to the network size, it not only influences the accuracy of a model but also the time taken for simulation on specific platforms thus impact the energy usage on hardware. 

The accuracy is dependent on the input spiking rates and the time last for each testing sample, see \textcolor{red}{Fig~}.
\textcolor{red}{Describe the figure.}
\textcolor{red}{Fig~a} shows the recognition accuracy changes over the input spiking rates.
As more spikes injected to the network, the decision neurons become more active and the output disparity enlarges among the decision neurons.
However, with increasing spikes injected the spiking rate of the decision neurons saturate to the limit of $1/tau\_refrac$, where $tau\_refrac$ refers to the refractory period.  
So, the rate gap between the correct decision neuron and the others narrow as the input rates increase to a certain level.
\textcolor{red}{Fig~b} shows the recognition accuracy changes over the time last for each testing sample.
The longer an image is presented more information is gathered, so the accuracy climbs.

The latency of a SNN model is mainly the result of the input rates, although synaptic weights also play a role.
As the input rates grow, there are more spikes arriving at the decision neurons and triggering them to spike sooner.
Similar idea apply, if stronger weights are taken the membrane potential of a neuron reaches its threshold earlier.
\textcolor{red}{Fig~a and b} indicate the latency shortened with increasing input rates with both the original weights and scaled-up weights (10 times as the original).

\subsection{[Evangelos Stromatias]Case Study II}
% brief intro about dbn
Deep learning architectures and in particular Convolutional Networks \citep{lecun1998gradient} and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) \citep{Hinton_etal_2006} have been characterised as one of the breakthrough technologies of the decade \citep{MIT_TechReview}. One of the advantages of these type of networks is that their performance can be increased by adding more layers \citep{Hinton_Contr_Divergence2006}.

However, state-of-the-art deep networks comprise a large number of layers, neurons and connections resulting in high energy demands, communication overheads, and high response latencies. This is a problem for mobile and robotic platforms which may have limited computational and power resources but require fast system responses. 


% about oneils model 
\citet{10.3389/fnins.2013.00178} proposed a method to map off-line trained DBNs into a spiking neural networks and take advantage of the real-time performance and energy efficiency of neuromorphic platforms. This lead initially to an implementation on an event-driven Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) called Minitaur \citep{dannminitaur} and then on the SpiNNaker platform \citep{iscasSpinnakerAcceptedDemo,SpinnakerDBN2015}. For this work we used an off-line trained\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dannyneil/edbn/}} spiking DBN with a 784-500-500-10 network topology. Simulations take place on a software spiking neural network simulator named Brian \citep{briansim} and results are verified on the SpiNNaker platform.

\subsubsection{Training}

DBNs consist of stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), which are fully connected recurrent networks but without any connections between neurons of the same layers. Training is performed unsupervised using the standard Contrastive Divergence (CD) rule \citep{Hinton_Contr_Divergence2006} and only the output layer is trained in a supervised manner. The main difference is the activation function used for the neurons. \citet{10.3389/fnins.2013.00178} proposed the use of the Siegert approximation \citep{Jug_etal_2012} as the activation function, which returns the expected firing rate of a leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neuron given input firing rates, input weights, and standard neuron parameters.

\subsubsection{Testing}
After the training process the trained synaptic weights can be used in a spiking neural network which consists of LIF neurons with delta-current synapses. Table~\ref{Tab:NeuralParams} shows the LIF parameters used in the simulations.

The pixels of each MNIST digit from the testing set are converted into Poisson spike trains with a rate proportional to the intensity of their pixel, while their firing rates are scaled so that the total firing rate of the input population is constant \citep{10.3389/fnins.2013.00178}.

 
Table~\ref{tab:casimulators} presents a comparison of the classification accuracies (CA) between the rate-based implementation in MATLAB using the Siegert neurons, Brian, and SpiNNaker. %The default fixed-point weight precision for SpiNNaker is 22 bits, 6 for the integer part and 16 for the fractional part (Q6.16) \citep{}.





\subsubsection{Evaluation}

%Investigate CA as a function of weight precision
%and input firing rates for neuromorphic plaforms 
%verify brian results with spinnaker for a particular
%weight precision.

Neuromorphic platforms may have limited hardware resources to store the synaptic weights \citep{Schemmel_etal10,Merolla08082014}. In order to investigate how the precision of the weights affect the classification accuracy (CA) of a spiking DBN the double floating point weights of the offline trained network were converted to different fixed-point representations. The following notation will be used throughout this paper, Q\textit{m.f}, where \textit{m} signifies the number of bits for the integer part (including the sign bit) and \textit{f} the number of bits used for the fractional part.

Figure~\textbf{[WILLADDFIGURE]} shows the effect of reduced weight bit precision on the CA for different input firing rates on the Brian simulator. To validate the results of the software simulator a simulation ran on SpiNNaker for a weight resolution of Q3.8. SpiNNaker achieved a CA of 94.94\% when 1500~Hz was used for the input population \citep{SpinnakerDBN2015,iscasSpinnakerAcceptedDemo}. Brian for the same firing rates and weight precision achieved a CA of 94.955\%. Results are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:casimulators}   


\begin{table}[h]

%Moreover, the difference between the software simulation that utilises double floating-point
%351 weights and SpiNNaker with Q3.8 fixed-point weights is 0.06%, which is in agreement with a previous
%352 study (Stromatias et al., 2015b).

An additional experiment was conducted to investigate the classification latency, which is the time passed between the first input spike and the first output spike, and the CA as a function of the total number of input spikes per second. The input rates were varied from 500~Hz to 2000~Hz. Results can be seen in Figure~\ref{Fig:brianLatency}. Simulations ran in Brian for all 10,000 MNIST digits from the training set and for 4 trials. Figure~\ref{Fig:spinnLatency1500hz} shows a histogram of the classification latencies on SpiNNaker when the input rates are 1500~Hz. The mean classification latency for the particular spiking DBN on SpiNNaker is 16~ms which is identical to the Brian simulation seen in Figure~\ref{Fig:brianLatency}.

Finally, this particular spiking DBN ran on a single SpiNNaker chip and dissipated less than 0.3~W when 2000 spikes per second per digit were used, Figure~\textbf{[ADD FIGURE]}. The identical network ran on Minitaur \citep{}, an event-driven FPGA implementation, and consumed 1.5~W when 1000 spikes per image were used.
