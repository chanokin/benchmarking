\section{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}
\subsection{Hardware-Independent}
Accuracy (correct, incorrect, ambiguous.) \\
Training data used (how many times each image is presented.)\\
Training done with rate-based\\
Network topology (complexity.)\\
Supervised or not.\\
Number of classes obtained for unsupervised.\\
Was there any preprocessing done?\\
Measure used to decide classes\\



\subsection{Hardware-Specific}
	\subsubsection{Training Time}
