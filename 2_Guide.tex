\subsection{The Goals}
With this benchmark we hope to (1) promote meaningful comparison among algorithms in the field of neural computation, (2) allow comparison with conventional image recognition methods, (3) provide an assessment of the state of the art in spike-based visual recognition, and (4) help researchers identify future directions and advance the field.
